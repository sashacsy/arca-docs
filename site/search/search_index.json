When working with PDF issues, please refer to the Single Object Content guidance above.</p> <p>Ingests of paged content differ in that the media files for each child item are separated into their own subdirectory. Instead of a <code>file</code> column, the metadata spreadsheet contains a <code>directory</code> column to point to the subdirectory containing all media files for that child. These subdirectories should include image files at the very least, but may optionally contain OCR/HOCR text files if available for each page.</p> <p>While paged content parents and children can technically be ingested in the same batch as long as they appear sequentially in the spreadsheet (parent before children), the Arca Office recommends creating parent objects as a separate, primary step. Creating the parents (e.g. collections, books and newspapers) separately from the children reduces the opportunities for human error and issues with sequencing, field or value templates, etc.</p> <p>Before preparing paged content, make sure to review the official Islandora documentation on filenaming and subdirectory structure to ensure the proper sequence of pages is maintained upon ingest.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/batch-operations/create/#an-important-note-on-paragraphs","title":"An Important Note on Paragraphs","text":"<p>Arca's installation of Islandora makes extensive use of Paragraphs, a special Drupal unit that allows for sets of repeatable fields. A list of all of the Paragraph types available by default in an Arca site can be viewed at <code>/admin/structure/paragraphs_type</code>. One of the most important Paragraph types is Origin Information, which includes the primary date field for all repository items (<code>field_date_issued</code>).</p> <p>Because repository items being ingested may have metadata in fields that are part of Paragraphs, these fields must be accounted for in the config YAML for the task. Arca's config YAML templates for both paged content and single object content include all possible Paragraph fields by default.</p> <p>If you are ingesting a batch of items that does not make use of a particular subfield in a paragraph, the row for that subfield can be nulled out by adding a <code>#</code> to the start of the line in the config file. Any null/blank values that aren't nulled out with <code>#</code> will need to be accounted for with double delimiters in each row of the metadata. See Paragraph Data Entry for further detail.</p> <p>Let's take a closer look at how Paragraphs and their subfields are structured in the config YAML templates. The following excerpt of the paged content config YAML template lists the fields for the Origin Information Paragraph:</p> <pre><code>paragraph_fields:\n  node:\n    field_origin_information:\n      type: origin_information\n      field_order:\n        - field_event_type\n        - field_place\n        - field_date_issued\n        - field_date_captured\n        - field_other_date\n        - field_copyright_date\n        - field_publisher\n        - field_edition\n        - field_issuance\n        - field_frequency\n      field_delimiter: ':'\n      subdelimiter: '|'\n</code></pre> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li><code>field_origin_information</code> is the machine name of the Paragraph's field on Repository Items. It can be found on your site here: <code>/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields</code>. This is the field name/header that you will be adding values under in your metadata CSV.</li> <li><code>type</code> is the machine name of the Paragraph Type, available here: <code>/admin/structure/paragraphs_type</code>. It's usually just the field name without <code>field_</code>.</li> <li><code>field_order</code> is followed by a list of subfields that exist within that paragraph. As noted earlier in this section, you can null out any subfields you are not using by adding a <code>#</code> to the start of the subfield's line in the config file.</li> <li><code>field_delimiter</code> is the chosen delimiter between each of the subfields in the paragraph.</li> <li><code>subdelimiter</code> is the chosen delimiter between several paragraphs on the same object (i.e., multiple Origin Information paragraphs)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"how-to/batch-operations/create/#paragraph-data-entry","title":"Paragraph Data Entry","text":""},{"location":"how-to/batch-operations/create/#single-paragraph","title":"Single Paragraph","text":"<p>The metadata spreadsheet templates contain columns for Paragraph fields as a whole.

How can I display one specific value?  </p> <p>Your metadata display profile (or Solr search result field, or wherever you're using a Solr field) is probalby using the Dublin Core Solr field (<code>dc.description</code>, <code>dc.identifier</code>, etc.) rather than the more granular MODS Solr field. Dublin Core is not as precise as MODS, and many DC elements combine different MODS elements into one.  </p> <p>For example, <code>dc.description</code> will combine MODS abstract, and all MODS note elements.

Do I need to change the ingest form? <p>No!  </p> <p>Your ingest form is probably fine. Solr generates many fields based on the metadata you ingest via the form, and your object's content model metadata display profile is only configured to display a certain selection of those.
